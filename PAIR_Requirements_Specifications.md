# PAIR Requirements Specifications

## Introduction

Ontology Requirements Specifications refers to the activity of collecting the requirements that the ontology should fulfill, e.g. the reason to build the ontology, target group, intended uses, possibily reached through a consensus process (see Su√°rez-Figueroa et al. (2009), *How to Write and Use the Ontology Requirements Specification Document*, Springer:Berlin, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-05151-7_16).

See `PAIR_Cahier_des_Charges.md` for the french version.

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of the PAIR ontology is to provide a generic vocabulary adapted to the realm of various communities in order allow for the interconnection of the later through interoperable information systems.
The PAIR ontology is designed to be connected to other ontologies such as:
- Ontologies describing occupational activities such as project management or market places (interlinking),
- Ontologies from [LOV](http://lov.okfn.org/) on which PAIR is based (alignment).

## 2. Scope

PAIR is a domain ontology describing the life of communities such as associations, companies, municipalities or other ecosystems of actors.

## 3. Implementation Language

OWL and RDFS.

## 4. Intended End-Users

Individuals and organizations wishing to become part of a network.

## 5. Intended Uses

The structuration of an ecosystem of actors (individuals and organizations) around ideas, projects, activities and ressources.

## 6. Ontology requirements

The PAIR ontology must integrage the main concepts and relationships caracterizing the life of communities beyond their diversity and their specificity.
It constitutes a basis which may be extended by additional modules describing more specific domains, occupations, activities, etc.
